Lab: Implementing the ArrayList Class

The add Methods
 1. Suppose n items are to be inserted into a MyArrayList object:
 a) The array of size k must be copied into a new array of size k + 1 for each 
    new addition. The total time would be the sum of (k + 1) + (k + 2) + ... +
    (k + n).
 b) The array will only need to be copied over every n/p times where p is the 
    number that the array gets expanded when necessary. When the array fills 
    up, then the array of size k is copied, and the size increased by 10 
    (k+10), then, when the array fills up again, the (k+10) array is copied 
    and the size is incremented by 10 ((k+10)+10).  Every time the array is 
    expanded, p is incremented.
 c) The array will only need to be copied log_2n times. If n = 2^t, then there 
    will be t expansions. Substitute t for log_2n and we get 2n - 1.
